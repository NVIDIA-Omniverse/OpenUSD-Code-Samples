## OpenUSD Code Samples OSS Contribution Rules

#### Issue Tracking

* All enhancement, bugfix, or change requests must begin with the creation of a [OpenUSD Code Samples Issue Request](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/OpenUSD-Code-Samples/issues).
  * The issue request must be reviewed by OpenUSD Code Samples engineers and approved prior to code review.


#### Coding Guidelines

- All source code contributions must strictly adhere to the [OpenUSD Code Samples Guidelines](CODE-SAMPLE-GUIDELINES.md).

- In addition, please follow the existing conventions in the relevant file, submodule, module, and project when you add new code or when you extend/fix existing functionality.

- Avoid introducing unnecessary complexity into existing code so that maintainability and readability are preserved.

- Try to keep pull requests (PRs) as concise as possible:
  - Avoid committing commented-out code.
  - Wherever possible, each PR should address a single concern. If there are several otherwise-unrelated things that should be fixed to reach a desired endpoint, our recommendation is to open several PRs and indicate the dependencies in the description. The more complex the changes are in a single PR, the more time it will take to review those changes.

- Write commit titles using imperative mood and [these rules](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/), and reference the Issue number corresponding to the PR. Following is the recommended format for commit texts:
```
#<Issue Number> - <Commit Title>

<Commit Body>
```

- Ensure that the Sphinx build log is clean, meaning no warnings or errors should be present.

- Ensure that all code blocks execute correctly prior to submitting your code.

- All OSS components must contain accompanying documentation (READMEs) describing the functionality, dependencies, and known issues.

  - See `README.md` for existing samples and plugins for reference.

- All OSS components must have an accompanying test.

  - If introducing a new component, such as a plugin, provide a test sample to verify the functionality.

- Make sure that you can contribute your work to open source (no license and/or patent conflict is introduced by your code). You will need to [`sign`](#signing-your-work) your commit.

- Thanks in advance for your patience as we review your contributions; we do appreciate them!


#### Pull Requests
Developer workflow for code contributions is as follows:

1. Developers must first [fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) the [upstream](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/OpenUSD-Code-Samples) TensorRT OSS repository.

2. Git clone the forked repository and push changes to the personal fork.

  ```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git OpenUSD-Code-Samples
# Checkout the targeted branch and commit changes
# Push the commits to a branch on the fork (remote).
git push -u origin <local-branch>:<remote-branch>
  ```

3. Once the code changes are staged on the fork and ready for review, a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) (PR) can be [requested](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) to merge the changes from a branch of the fork into a selected branch of upstream.
  * Exercise caution when selecting the source and target branches for the PR.
  * Creation of a PR creation kicks off the code review process.
  * At least one OpenUSD Code Samples engineer will be assigned for the review.
  * While under review, mark your PRs as work-in-progress by prefixing the PR title with [WIP].

4. Since there is no CI/CD process in place yet, the PR will be accepted and the corresponding issue closed only after adequate testing has been completed, manually, by the developer and/or OpenUSD Code Samples engineer reviewing the code.


#### Signing Your Work

* We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

  * Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:
  ```bash
  $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```
  This will append the following to your commit message:
  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```
