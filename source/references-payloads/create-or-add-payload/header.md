A `Payload <https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/release/glossary.html#usdglossary-payload>`_ is a composition arc that functions similar to a Reference to enable users to aggregate layers or assets onto a Stage. The difference is that a users can choose to not load a Payload. This can help users see the full hierarchy of a Stage, but only load the heavy parts ( i.e. Payloads) that they need. A Payload targets a prim from a layer and loads it and all of its descendants into a new namespace within the referencing layer. This snippet shows how to add a Payload to a prim. A single prim can have multiple Payloads.
