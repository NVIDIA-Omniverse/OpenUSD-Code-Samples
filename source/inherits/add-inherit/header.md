# Add an Inherit

FIXME:
An `Inherit <https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/release/glossary.html#usdglossary-inherits>` is a composition arc that enables a prim to contain all of the scene description contained in the base prim it inherits. This enables users to author opinions on the base prim that are broadcast to all the prims that inherit it. The `Inherit USD Glossary entry <https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/release/glossary.html#usdglossary-inherits>` explains the nuances of the composition arc in more detail.
