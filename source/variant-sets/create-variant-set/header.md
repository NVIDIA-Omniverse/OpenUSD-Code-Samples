.. note::
    If this is your first time authoring a variant set, we recommend that you follow `Authoring Variants USD tutorial <https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/docs/Authoring-Variants.html>` first.

FIXME:

A `Variant Set <https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/release/glossary.html#usdglossary-variantset>` is a composition arc that serves as a sort of "switchable Reference" allowing you to provide alternate property opinions or entire prim hierarchies. In this snippet, you'll find how to create a Variant Set, add variants to the new Variant Set and author opinions for each variant.
