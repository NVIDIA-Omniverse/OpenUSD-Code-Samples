Certain functions may return a `Usd.Prim` object, but the Prim may not exist due to an incorrect path or because of changes on the Stage. You can use [Usd.Object.IsValid()](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/dev/api/class_usd_object.html#ac532c4b500b1a85ea22217f2c65a70ed) to check if the Prim is valid or exists.
