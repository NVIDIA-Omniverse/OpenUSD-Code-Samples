Utility functions that allow you to print a string representation of a single
prim, or export a single prim into a layer by itself.

Particularly useful for debugging large scenes, as USD provides `Export()` and
`ExportToString()` at the stage level, but has no equivalent utitlities for
outputting information about only a single prim.
