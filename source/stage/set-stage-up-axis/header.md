You can set the `upAxis` metadata on the stage using `UsdGeom.SetStageUpAxis` to define which world axis points up. The tokens for the different axes are scoped in `UsdGeom.Tokens`.

```{note}
Fallback stage upAxis is Y.
```

```{warning}
Existing objects will not be automatically rotated to adapt to the stage `upAxis`. Learn more about [stage up axis](https://openusd.org/release/api/group___usd_geom_up_axis__group.html).
